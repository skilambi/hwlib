# hwlib - Hardware Library

Hardware Library i.e. hwlib contains multiple RTL modules that can be part of a system. Each RTL block will have its associated documentation in the form of an MD file.
HWLIB should be instantatiated as a subrepo in a *project* so that these blocks are available for building systems.
